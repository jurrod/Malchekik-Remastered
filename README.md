## What is this?
<p>
I'm glad you asked, mysterious narrator voice in whomever's head is reading this, what exactly <strong>IS</strong> this project?
Well, it is a sandbox, a sandbox of webdev for Samuel Kuchek, Jarrod Masarik, and Alex Malfregot to cathardically express themselves in an effort to seem artistic, oh and also there
might be some cool javascript and media production, who knows?!
